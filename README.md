### **_Future Updates_**

#### In the future I would like to add a comment thread for each review, that way you can interact with other user and talk about your experience.

#### I would also like to change the ratings from 1-5 to a star rating from 1-5 where the user can select their rating with stars instead of typing in 1-5.

#### I want to add some form of user authentication so that a review may not be edited or deleted by anyone on the page. These options should only be accesible to the user who posted the review.
